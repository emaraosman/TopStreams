The app structure should be fairly simple, 2 pages or less for any user. This app will definitely be heavy on the backend of development, and front end should be kept simple but effective in display.

Expected challenges are in the api; retrieval and updating data continously from multiple apis. 

Phases of Completion

The first step is going to be reading all of the api documentations and getting all the apis working properly.
Setup the file system for the backend.
Design a view that is simple but engaging.
Fetch apis on back and retrieve json.
Parse.
Organize and present.
Test.
